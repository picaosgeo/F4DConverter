--fixed a critical bug where calling an OpenGL API to draw meshes caused a memory access violation.
  (disabling vertex attrib array for texture coordinate before drawing meshes without textures were missed.)
--some memory-leaks detected. these will be fixed soon.
--changed the way of saving a lego structure texture file.
  (saves it without any condition now)

--changed the algorithm used in VBO to check if vertices to be added is already added in VBO or not
   (using vector searching -> using map searching)
--changed way of retrieving texture file names from Assimp
   (multibyte to wide char -> UTF-8 to wide char)
--changed the char encoding used in writing texture file names into F4D
   (multibyte -> UTF-8)
--fixed bug where texture coordinates of lego structure are made incorrectly
--fixed a bug where the texture file of lego structure is made conditionally

-- fixed the bug where incorrect texture coordinates were created from .3DS files.
-- implemented guid extraction of objects from IFC files.
-- fixed the algorithm to perform an intersection test between a cube and a triangle so that it decides any cases where both a cube and a tirangle touch each other as intersection happens.
